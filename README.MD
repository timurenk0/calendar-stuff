# Teamup Calendar Manager

A **TypeScript-based library** for managing [Teamup](https://teamup.com/) calendars and events with ease.  
This project also includes a small frontend (for testing and demonstration purposes) and a backend to interact with Teamup APIs, but the **core of this repository is the reusable library**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📅 **Create, read, update, and delete** Teamup calendar events programmatically.
- 🔑 Built with **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability.
- 🖥️ Comes with a **minimal frontend UI** for quick testing and demos.
- ⚡ Supports running **frontend** and **backend** simultaneously in development.
