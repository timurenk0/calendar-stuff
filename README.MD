# MUST
- Send routes.ts endpoints output instead of .json() as the result is already JSON-type. Avoid nested object bullshit
- Normalize calendar config and subcalendar endpoints output like events and add interfaces.
- Finish json-api endpoints:
    - add PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE methods

- CHANGE "checkMazhar" METHOD AND GENERALIZE TO ALL CALENDARS

# IDEAS
- When selecting event, show possible dates where this event can be placed based on professor, student and room availabilty (check sub-calendars)
    - No access to subcalendars suck toes

- Automate event addition process (start/end date, event period, etc.)

# MUST
- Rules for start.end times (input user)
- times a week
- break time
- check across all calendars
